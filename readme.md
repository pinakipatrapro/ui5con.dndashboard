## **UI5 custom library** `**ui5-cc-dndashboard**`

> **DISCLAIMER**: This is a community project and there is no official support for this package! Also the functionality may stop working at any time in future with newer versions of the UI5 tooling!

### **What is it?**

This package contains a UI5 Custom Control Library which enables the creation of _**Drag and Drop Dashboards**_  in UI5. This is fully configurable to include any UI5 controls or third party controls. This library primarily consists of 4 controls:

1.  ui5-cc-dndashboard.**Dashboard** 
2.  ui5-cc-dndashboard.**DashboardTile**
3.  ui5-cc-dndashboard.**DashboardChart**
4.  ui5-cc-dndashboard.**FunnelChart**

### **Install**

```plaintext
npm i ui5-cc-dndashboard --save-dev
```

**ui5-tooling-modules ** is a pre-requisite which allows us to use NPM package names for AMD-like dependencies. More details [**here**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-modules)

## Editing with Markdown output

The [CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG](https://ckeditor.com/) editor lets you use this flexible yet simple markup language in the GitHub flavor. The editor-produced Markdown output supports the most important features, like [links](https://ckeditor.com/), **different** kinds of _emphasis_, `inline code formatting` or code blocks:

```css
p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
```

## Formatting blocks with Markdown

Markdown can be used to create various block-level features, such as:

*   Block quotes
*   Headings
    1.  Heading 1
    2.  Heading 2
    3.  Heading 3
*   Lists, including nested ones
    *   Numbered lists
    *   Bulleted lists
    *   To-do lists

## Support for tables in Markdown

Bear in mind that Markdown has only very basic support for tables, so things like table styles or merged cells will not work.
